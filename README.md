# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
### We are  evaluating models with unbalanced classes and using imbalanced-learn along with scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models. We wish to accomplish this through resampling.

## Results
### The balanced accuracy score was approximately 87% for both metrics

### The precision and recall scores were .03 and .66 for high credit risk and scores of 1.00 and .88 for low credit risk. The same can be said for the second metric.
## Summary 
### The results for the metrics are low in value. Based on the results, individuals are more likely to be at a lower risk of credit than at a higher risk of credit, which is a benefit. I would recommend separating the average scores and the total scores so that the results would be different. I also think completely labeling the units for precision and recall would avoid confusion for the user reading these results.
